About the Project: 

Presented a Web based application where Skin-Cancer images can be uploaded to get the closest prediction between 7 different classes of skin cancer using Deep Learning to perform the prediction. Resnet50, MobileNet, VGG16, CNN models have been trained on the HAM10000 Dataset after which the model with best validation accuracy has been employed in the webapp. Classes of Skin Cancer Images are Melanoma, Benign Keratosis, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Vascular Skin Lesions, Dermatofibroma and Neoplasms The application is designed to be used by medical professionals for a quick result.

For our this project we used the Ham10000 dataset. After pre-processing, we got a total of 38568 training images and 938 validation images. We developed our model using Keras and TensorFlow. Our model shows promising results with an accuracy of 89.77%. As a result, we developed a web based application where Skin-Cancer images can be uploaded to get the closest prediction between 7 different classes of skin cancer (Benign, Keratosis, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Vascular Skin Lesions, Dermatofibroma and Neoplasms) using Deep Learning to perform the prediction.

To run the Web Application you will require flask installed on the system. Next in the Skin_Cancer folder is the sc_app.py which can be executed as a python file and thenon the local server the web app can be accessed after which the project can be tested.
